      <h2>Personal Story</h2>
      <p>I adopted a dog to use as an ESA after my first semester. I had fallen into a pretty heavy depression and was looking things to help me
        out of it. I had been seeing a counselor and was already on medication. After my own research and heavy consideration I decided to adopt a dog. I was
        lucky enough to qualify for an ESA, so I had the opportunity to keep her in the dorms. It was the best possible decision I could have made, and I hope more
        college students consider adopting a companion. </p>
